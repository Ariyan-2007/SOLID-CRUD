# SOLID-CRUD
Pretext: I've decided to make a short Web Application API based Backend using the SOLID Principles so that I can better understand the principles myself and hopefully it will help other people who finds this to understand the principles themselves.

What I'll be using to implement:

Frontend: N/A <br> Backend: NodeJS -> Typescript <br> Database: N/A

P.S. N/A field values are subject to change in the future depending on how far I go with this project.

## SOLID Principle
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible, maintainable, and extendable. 
### Single Responsibility Principle:
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
### Open/Closed Principle:
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
### Liskov Substitution Principle:
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
### Interface Segregation Principle:
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
### Dependency Inversion Principle:
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
